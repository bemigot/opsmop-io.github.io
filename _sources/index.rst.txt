* Flexibility
* Language design
* Code quality
* Speed

Status
======

Alpha.

OpsMop is in language-preview phase, and we are still refactoring some minor
parts and working on plugins. Existing modules/plugins are somewhat limited
and features are not fully implemented in all cases, but the language itself
is very well evolved.

* We will be open to pull requests and bug reports starting December 1.
* Work after December 1 will be heavily focused towards modules and plugins, plus small language editions.
* Documentated language features will be locked in and largely stable by January 2019
* First tagged stable release in Feburary 2019

If you like where this is going, now is the time to join up with thoughts
and potentially code. See :ref:`community` and :ref:`development`.

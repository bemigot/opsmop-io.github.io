Pull Mode
---------

OpsMop is going to have a very pluggable pull mode capable of using multiple transports, signalling mechanisms, and 
reporting callbacks.

There may also be some light-but-optional-and-generic integration with Vespene.

Stop by the :ref:`forum` to share your thoughts and ideas.

Coming Soon!

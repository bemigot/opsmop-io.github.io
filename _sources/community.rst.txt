.. _community:

Community
---------

The purpose of the OpsMop community is to come together to build the system we all want to use.
We love to hear use cases, stories, challenges, and ideas and learn from everyone's experiences.

Participation in discussions is vital and strongly encouraged.
Code contributions are always welcome, but never required.


.. _forum:

Forum
=====

The official Opsmop discussion form is hosted at `talk.msphere.io <https://talk.msphere.io/>`_.  The purpose of the forum
is to get help, ask questions, post ideas, coordinate development, and brainstorm features.

In respect of worldwide time zones and the nature of software development, there is no official realtime chat channel.
If you post on StackOverflow or Reddit, we are unlikely to see your posts. The official forum 
will always be the best place to get help.

.. _github:

GitHub
======

OpsMop lives on GitHub `here <https://github.com/opsmop/opsmop>`_.

Code contributions are very welcome! To submit a pull request to the master branch after reading :ref:`development`.
Often it is almost always best to discuss a development idea on the forum to discuss suitability and to avoid duplicate efforts.

We're also quite welcome to have documentation fixes submitted.  The documentation
source lives in the 'docs/source' folder of the main repo, except for module docs, which are auto-generated from content
in the `opsmop-demo <https://github.com/opsmop/opsmop-demo>`_ repo.

Bugs should also be filed directly in GitHub, but if you would like some help or want to discuss a bug more widely, the
forum is fine for that too. If you have a question such as 'how do I do X?' that's a better topic for the forum
versus a github ticket, and more people will be able to help.

What about feature requests? We don't track feature requests in GitHub because it is often viewed as mean-spirited to close them and sometimes
opinions change, and closing something doesn't mean we might not want to do something later. Please feel free to 
talk about ideas on the :ref:`forum`, and start a new thread for any idea that you like!

Next Steps

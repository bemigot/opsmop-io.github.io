Community
---------

The purpose of the OpsMop community is to come together to build the ultimate configuration system we all want to use.
We love to hear use cases, stories, challenges, and ideas and learn from everyone's experiences.

Code contributions are always welcome, but never required.

.. _forum:

Forum
=====

The official Opsmop discussion form is hosted `here <https://talk.vespene.io/c/opsmop-general>`.  The purpose of the forum
is to get help, ask questions, post ideas, coordinate development, and brainstorm features.  While this is a subforum
of the `Vespene <http://vespene.io>` forum and GitHub, OpsMop and Vespene do not require one another, but are simply
two projects started by the same person.

In respect of worldwide time zones and the nature of software development, there is no official realtime chat channel.
While we welcome sharing on site like StackOverflow or Reddit, we are unlikely to see your posts. The official forum
will always be the best place to get help.

.. _github:

GitHub
======

OpsMop lives on GitHub `here <https://github.com/vespene-io/opsmop>`_.

Code contributions are very welcome! To submit a pull request to the master branch after reading :ref:`development`.
Often it may be best to discuss a development idea on the forum before contributing to avoid duplicate efforts.

Of course not all contributions are code.  We're also quite welcome to have documentation improvements.  The documentation
source lives in the 'docs/source' folder of the main repo, except for module docs, which are auto-generated from content
in the `opsmop-demo <https://github.com/vespene-io/opsmop-demo>`_ repo. We're also of course very appreciative of bug reports and helping other users with questions.

Bugs should also be filed directly in GitHub, but if you would like some help or want to discuss a bug more widely, the
forum is fine for that too. If you have a question such as 'how do I do X?' that's a better topic for the forum
versus a github ticket, and more people will be able to help.

What about feature requests? We don't track feature requests in GitHub because it is often viewed as mean-spirited to close them and sometimes
opinions change, and closing something doesn't mean we might not want to do something later. Please feel free to 
talk about ideas on the :ref:`forum`, and start a new thread for any idea that you like!
